A good starting point for understanding some of the key concepts in OpenSSL 3.0 is the libcrypto
[manual page](/master/man7/ossl-guide-libcrypto-introduction.md). Information and notes about
migrating existing applications to OpenSSL 3.0 are available in the
[OpenSSL 3.0 Migration Guide](/3.0/man7/migration_guide).

Ivan RistiÄ‡, the creator of <https://ssllabs.com>, has a free download of his *OpenSSL Cookbook*
that covers the most frequently used OpenSSL features and commands. It is updated often, and is
available at <https://www.feistyduck.com/books/openssl-cookbook/>. It is highly recommended.

Information related to the OpenSSL FIPS Validation [FIPS 140-2 validation](fips.md) is also
available.
